# 🌱 SeedBank 🌱


#### 📋 Description:

**SeedBank** is a webtite promotion social good on the cause that I care about: seed preservation. I was motivated to make this website because I believe preserving 
native seeds is essential for protecting our planet’s biodiversity and ensuring future generations have access to the natural resources they need. 
I've used `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to to build a interactive multipage website.

This game is built using **Python standard libraries only** (plus `pytest` for testing). It’s my final project for **Harvard CS50P (Introduction to Programming with Python)** — combining my love of basketball and programming. 👩‍💻+🏀
