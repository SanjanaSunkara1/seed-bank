# ðŸŒ± SeedBank ðŸŒ±

#### ðŸ“‹ Description:

[**Seedbank**](https://390ff148-b72c-43a3-bcb2-c25ae0e14b23-00-171cnv3j8wa74.kirk.replit.dev/index.html)  is a website promotion social good on the cause that I care about: seed preservation. I was motivated to make this website because I believe preserving native seeds is essential for protecting our planetâ€™s biodiversity and ensuring future generations have access to the natural resources they need. I've used `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to to build a interactive multipage website.
